# portfolio-FrontEnd

Hello there! My name is Fabrizio and I wanna go on with a project. I'd like to make a software that simulates a fast food restaurant.
I will use tkinter as the GUI, and Sqlite3 as the database. Using the MVC pattern, I'll make a CRUD, with buttons and commands.

The following link contains my website, on wich I explain how I like to work, and my plannings. ---> https://fabriziomanzopeluso.my.canva.site/
